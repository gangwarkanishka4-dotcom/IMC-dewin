"""
face_db.py

Raw sqlite3 storage for:
  - employees: local, minimal roster (employee_id, name) used to validate
    labels server-side without depending on the external face-enrollment
    service at request time. See FACE_TRAINING.md for why this exists.
  - face_embeddings: the enrollment "gallery" (many embeddings per person_id,
    since each accepted capture adds another vector — no retraining needed).
  - face_pending: unrecognized / low-confidence tracked faces waiting for a
    human to assign a person_id (live-correction queue, unchanged).
  - face_training_captures: EVERY finished track's best frame, regardless of
    match confidence — the bulk dataset for the manual labeling UI + the
    classifier training pipeline. Deliberately separate from face_pending,
    which only ever sees low-confidence captures.
  - collection_sessions: persistent state for a multi-day background
    collection run (start/end time, which cameras, status, activity) so a
    backend restart can detect and resume an unfinished session instead of
    silently losing it. See FACE_TRAINING.md "7-day collection sessions".

Matches the style of camera_db.py — no ORM, CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS,
module-level connection helper.
