face_pipeline.py

Per-camera worker: detect -> track -> pick best frame per track -> align ->
embed (ArcFace) -> match against gallery -> auto-tag or push to review queue.

Design choices, and why:
  - YOLOv8-face for detection: fast, GPU-friendly, good on RTSP streams.
  - ByteTrack for tracking: gives each face a stable track_id across frames
    so we only run recognition ONCE per track (on the best frame) instead of
    on every frame. This is the main latency fix vs. a naive per-frame loop.
    Uses the `supervision` package's ByteTrack implementation rather than
    the original `yolox` package — `yolox` ships a native extension that
    requires cmake/a C++ toolchain to build and failed to install on this
    box; `supervision` is a pure-Python/numpy port of the same algorithm
    with no native build step, so it's the safer dependency here.
  - InsightFace (buffalo_l, ArcFace) for embeddings: we do NOT train/retrain
    this model. It's a fixed embedding extractor. "Training" = appending
    vectors to a person's bucket in the gallery (see face_db.py). This also
    means alignment matters a lot — buffalo_l's detector gives 5-point
    landmarks used for alignment before embedding, which was almost
    certainly missing from the old broken pipeline (raw bbox crops fed
    straight into ArcFace produce noisy embeddings -> everything reads as
    "unknown").

Install:
    pip install ultralytics insightface onnxruntime supervision opencv-python
    # swap onnxruntime for onnxruntime-gpu if this machine actually has CUDA

Model files:
    - YOLO face weights: any yolov8n-face / yolov11n-face .pt (fine-tuned for
      faces, not the generic COCO yolov8n.pt — that only detects "person").
      NOT bundled here and not auto-downloaded — see FACE_RECOGNITION_WIRING.md
      for why this is a manual step.
    - InsightFace buffalo_l downloads automatically on first run to
      ~/.insightface/models/buffalo_l.
